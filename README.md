# Roll Your Own Chrome Extension

Super simple, barebones Chrome Extension/Script.

## What it's for?

This is a simple Chrome extension framework.
Use it as a starting point for your own app.

## How does it work?

[TBD]

> Things to know:
> manifest.json is important

### Install it yourself

After you clone the repo,

> 1 Go to chrome://extensions/
> 2 Make sure Developer Extensions is on (in the upper right)
> 3 Open your src dir via "Load Unpacked" (upper left tabs)

In the extensions bar you should see a friendly litte skull icon with the text "ChromeExt". Click it. (what could go wrong?)

You have to be on the Facebook find friends page (https://www.facebook.com/find-friends/browser/) (logged in) in order for this script to work.

##TBD or documented
-ALT-SHIFT-F runs it as well
-I'd like options whn clicked, e.g. how many to delete or 'All'
-limit it to Facebook.com only in permissions
-can I have a better test env than de-install/re-install the ext? (Ooh, that could be a 1 click ext based on this)
